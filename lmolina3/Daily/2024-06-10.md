Tasks Finished
===============
* Finished Post, Picture, Keyword and Relation structures
* Did test to see how the data is looking in the json files. 

Plan for tommorrow
=================
* I ran into an issue where user.get_followers(100) is going out of index. So I must fix this issue before I could run my test
* See how many users I could pull before hitting time rates. This will allow me to gauge how many users I could pull a day. 

What I learned today 
===================
* learned more about the data structures for the project.
