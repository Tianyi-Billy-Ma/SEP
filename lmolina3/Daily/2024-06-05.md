Tasks Finished 
==============
* Continued to work with the twikit library to test scrapping data off of twitter 
* Was able to create a system of adding keywords found in the users profile into the user_structure
* Was able to create a systme to go to users followers and following to find keywords in their profiles and tweets

Plan for tommorrow
=================
* Create a better try except program to save the data that it scrapes off of twitter before reaching rate limits 
* use the time library to bypass rate limits as the twikit library resets it's rate limits every 15 min.
