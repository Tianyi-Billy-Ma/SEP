Tasks Finished
=============
* Start to pull data from twitter
* Started to see what was the problem with get_followers, and get_following

Plan for Tommorrow
================
* Continue to work around the problems of get_followers, get_following
* Begin to pull users from twitter
* Create more accounts to avoid time rates

What I learn today 
=================
* I learned that client.search_user() allows for get_followers, get_following for the first 20 users. If I request more than 20 users the get_followers, get_following goes out of range. I tried to use .next() to get the next 20 followers but the functions go out of range. 
* pip installed and uninstalled twikit 
* read more about twikit documentaiton
