Tasks Finished
==============
Began replicating the provided json format for the doc files. Developed Python code that replicates the json output for the CodeBook section.





Plan for tomorrow
===============
Move the CodeBook code into a function, and write functions to convert the rest of the sections into json format, then join the fxn outputs into one json object.



What I have learned today
================

Familiarized with webscraping and json data structure
