Tasks Finished
==============
Starting experimenting with methods for NHANES: Used requests and regexes to isolate the .XPT file URLS from a NHANES webpage. Downloaded an XPT file into a dataframe.



Plan for tomorrow
===============
Continue developing the webscraping script and work on ways to organize the NHANES data.



What I have learned today
================

Reviewed re and requests python libraries and became more familiar with the format of NHANES data.
