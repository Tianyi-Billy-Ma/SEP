Opioid Misuse Detection with Dietary Pattern
============




Research Mentor: [Tianyi (Billy) Ma](https://tianyi-billy-ma.github.io/)

Students: 
* [Jack Mangione](https://j-mango-19.github.io/personal-site/)

* Leonardo Molina

In this project, we will leverage the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey**, providied by CDC.
The link is [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html).


Guidelines
=========
* All codes should put in YOURFOLDER/src/. Please make sure to upload your code at the end of everyday. 
* You should upload your code under your own branch, i.e., NDID (I already create these branches that for you). 
* All daily summary/report should go in YOURFOLDER/Daily/. I create a template in markdown, but if you prefer txt/doc, feel free to change it.
* Our meeting will hold via ZOOM [here](https://notredame.zoom.us/my/billyma3).


Timelines
=========

* Programming Environment Setup (1 - 2 days):
    * Git setup: Set up a version control system on GitHub.
    * Conda: Install the Conda and required packages.
    * Collaboration: Define collaboration protocol and commit guidelines.
* NHANES dataset (10 - 12 days):
    * Get familiar with the NHANES dataset.
    * Download and program to clean the dataset.
* Define patients who are facing opioid misuse (1-2 days):
    * Find columns/elements that we can use to define the opioid patients
    * Process the dataset upon our definition for prediction tasks.
* ML models for prediction tasks (10 - 12 days):
    * Learn existing naive ML models that we can use for node classification tasks.
    * Implement these models in Python.
    * Evaluate the performance of each model.
    * Analysis of the importance of each component, i.e., which criteria contribute more to the prediction tasks?
* LLMs for reasoning analysis (12 - 14 days):
    * Upon our analysis, we leverage LLMs for reasoning analysis, including the reason for the correlation between opioid misuse and dietary patterns.
    * We can further leverage LLMs as nutritionists to provide suggestions for patients to prevent opioid misuse/ opioid misuse recovery. 
* Documentation and Presentation ( 4-5 days):
    * Document the collected dataset and codes.
    * Validate the quality of the dataset and publish it on huggingface.
    * Prepare the presentation and poster to report our findings.
