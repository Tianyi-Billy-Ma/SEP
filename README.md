In this project, we will leverage the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey**, providied by CDC.
The link is [NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2011).


Guidelines
=========
* All codes should put in YOURFOLDER/src/. Please make sure to upload your code at the end of everyday. 
* You should upload your code under your own branch, i.e., NDID (I already create these branches that for you). 
* All daily summary/report should go in YOURFOLDER/Daily/. I create a template in markdown, but if you prefer txt/doc, feel free to change it.
* Our meeting will hold via ZOOM [here](https://notredame.zoom.us/my/billyma3).
