=======

Our new project is to leverage Graph Neural Network to detect (illicit) drug trafficking on social media. Jack will work on Instagram and Leo will work on X (Twitter).

We will have a meeting at 1:00 pm and before that, please complete the following tasks:
* Register a Social Media Developer Account for the project.
* Read some tutorials on how to use APIs for data crawling on social media.
* Generate API Keys from the registered platform. 
* Read the paper [GCN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907) and [MetaHG](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/e234e195f3789f05483378c397db1cb5-Paper.pdf) to have a better understanding of the new project.
* Start to code some script for data crawling. (Maybe find python packages that build for Instagram/X API).

It is alright if you cannot finish all the tasks before the meeting. We will discuss the progress and plan for the next steps during the meeting.
