### Tasks

What we have:

Datasets: Twitter, Aminer, DBLP,
Models: GCN, GAT, GIN, MetaPath2Vec
Models by Billy: HeCo, HGT, HetGNN, HGMAE.


[Selfsupervised heterogeneous graph neural network with cocontrastive learning.]

Minority Classes: Seller, Buyer, and Related.
Majority Class: Negative

Create synthetic nodes for nodes in minority classes. 

For each minority class c: 
- Center Node: 
    Attribute Features: mean(X), X is the attribute features of nodes belong to the minority class. X is N_c * b => mean(X) 1 * b 
    Graph Structure: Connect every node that belongs to minority class c with center node. 
- Synthetic Node:
    For each misclassified node in minority class c.
    Attribute Features: average of attribute features of the node and its neighbors that also belong to the minority class c. 
    Graph Structure: Connect the synthetic node with nodes that are the neighbors of the node. Connect the synthetic node with the center node. 

For each generated attribute features for center node/synthetic node, feed them into a MLP.



MetaPath2Vec on Twitter 


MetaPath version of GNNs: 

GCN on Twitter 
GAT on Twitter 
GIN on Twitter



3 MetaPath based Adj Matrix A_1, A_2, A_3 

target_node_embeddings  N * b  
GNN_1, GNN_2, GNN_3


emb_i  = GNN_i(target_node_embeddings, A_i)

emb_i N * d (d is the output_dim of GNN)

embs = \[emb_1, emb_2, emb_3\]


Method 1

concated_embs = concat(embs)  => N * 3d  

MLP(conated_embs) => N * c  # Classifier 


Method 2

Att(embs) => alpha_i for emb_i

embs = alpha_1 * emb_1 + alpha_2 * emb_2 +  alpha_3 * emb_3

MLP(embs)
