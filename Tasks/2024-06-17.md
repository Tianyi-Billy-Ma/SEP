Tasks 2024-06-17
============================

 Read following three papers:
    * [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)

    * [Graph Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)
    * [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826)


There three papers introduce the three most popular and fundamental Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), i.e., GCN, GAT, and GIN, respectively. In the next three days, we will start from these three papers, to understand the big picture of the GNNs. 

Your tasks are implement these three methods, and conduct training, validation, and test pipeline on three benchmark datasets, i.e. Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. 

We will hold a meeting on 1:00 PM today, and I will show you a demo for implementation on GCN (the first paper). So before our meeting, read the first paper, and install following packages/programs on your PC: 

    - CUDA Toolkit 11.8/12.1
    - Pytorch (GPU for Windows and Default for MacOS)  
    - PyG (Pytorch-geometric)
